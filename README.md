[Build status](https://travis-ci.org/vtsukur/spring-rest-black-market.svg?branch=master)

## Building and Running

Make sure that [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) is installed and is on the path.

Project uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) as a build tool. Building is as easy as running the following shell command on Linux / Unix systems:

    ./gradlew build

This is the shell command for Windows:

    gradlew build

Once the application is built, run it as follows:

    java -jar build/libs/spring-rest-black-market.jar

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and surf through the black market ;)
